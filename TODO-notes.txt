Questions:
- How should be the AvailabilityRequest associations? How to write there "creates a request"?
- Should the athlete be connected to N/C, multiplicities, types (aggregation?)?
- Should the groupAthletes be only at the association or also as an attribute in the class?
	- Mark as Abstract in SportAdvisor if so.
